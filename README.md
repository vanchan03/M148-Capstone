Hello!

This is my capstone project under the data theory department at UCLA, where I worked with a large and messy set of data provided by Fingerhut, a subsidiary of the company BlueStem Brands. 
I did this project with fellow Data Theory senior Jason Clark.

We worked to provide machine learning and statistics based recommendations to Fingerhut, including time-series analysis, survivability analysis, and clustering.
This GitHub includes the code and explanation for our innovative data cleaning process, our machine learning models, and our final presentation.

Thank you!
